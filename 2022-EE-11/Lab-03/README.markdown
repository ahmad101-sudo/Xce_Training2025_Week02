# Programmable Counter Module

## Overview
The `programmable_counter` module is a Verilog implementation of an 8-bit programmable counter. It supports up/down counting, loading a preset value, and configurable maximum count, with outputs for the current count, terminal count (`tc`), and zero detection (`zero`).

## Features
- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock signal for synchronous operation.
  - `rst_n`: Active-low reset.
  - `load`: Loads `load_value` into the counter.
  - `enable`: Enables counting.
  - `up_down`: 0 for up-counting, 1 for down-counting.
  - `load_value` (8-bit): Value to load into the counter.
  - `max_count` (8-bit): Maximum count value.
- **Outputs**:
  - `count` (8-bit): Current counter value.
  - `tc`: Terminal count, set when `count >= max_count`.
  - `zero`: Set when `count == 0`.

## Operations
- **Reset**: When `rst_n = 0`, `count` resets to 0.
- **Load**: When `load = 1`, `count` is set to `load_value` (capped at `max_count` if `load_value > max_count`).
- **Up Counting** (`up_down = 0`, `enable = 1`): Increments `count` unless `tc = 1`, then wraps to `max_count`.
- **Down Counting** (`up_down = 1`, `enable = 1`): Decrements `count` unless `zero = 1`, then holds at 0.
- **Idle**: If `enable = 0` and `load = 0`, `count` remains unchanged.

## Implementation Details
- **Module Structure**:
  - Uses `always_ff` for sequential logic, triggered on `posedge clk` or `negedge rst_n`.
  - A `case` statement handles operation modes based on `{up_down, enable, load}`.
  - `zero` is assigned as `count == 0`.
  - `tc` is assigned as `count >= max_count`.
- **Behavior**:
  - On reset, `count` is set to 0.
  - On load, `count` is set to `load_value` if `load_value <= max_count`, else `max_count`.
  - During up-counting, `count` increments unless `tc` is set, then loads `max_count`.
  - During down-counting, `count` decrements unless `zero` is set, then holds at 0.

## Edge Cases
1. **Load Value Exceeds Max Count**:
   - If `load_value > max_count`, `count` is set to `max_count`.
2. **Max Count Change During Operation**:
   - If `max_count` changes, `tc` updates immediately (`count >= max_count`). Existing `count` values above the new `max_count` trigger `tc` but are not automatically adjusted unless `load` or counting occurs.
3. **Zero and Terminal Count**:
   - `zero = 1` when `count = 0`, stopping down-counting.
   - `tc = 1` when `count >= max_count`, causing up-counting to wrap to `max_count`.
4. **Simultaneous Load and Enable**:
   - Load takes precedence over counting when `load = 1`.
5. **Invalid States**:
   - Unhandled `{up_down, enable, load}` combinations (e.g., `011`, `111`) result in no `count` update.

## Usage
To use this module:
1. Instantiate it in your Verilog design.
2. Connect `clk`, `rst_n`, `load`, `enable`, `up_down`, `load_value`, and `max_count`.
3. Monitor `count`, `tc`, and `zero`.
This counter is suitable for timers, state machines, or control systems requiring flexible counting.
