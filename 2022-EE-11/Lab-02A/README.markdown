# 32-Bit Barrel Shifter Module

## Overview
The `barrel_shifter` module is a Verilog implementation of a 32-bit barrel shifter. It performs left or right shifts/rotates on a 32-bit input (`data_in`) based on a 5-bit shift amount (`shift_amt`) and control signals for direction (`left_right`) and mode (`shift_rotate`). The result is output as `data_out`.

## Features
- **Inputs**:
  - `data_in` (32-bit): Input data to shift/rotate.
  - `shift_amt` (5-bit): Number of positions to shift/rotate (0 to 31).
  - `left_right` (1-bit): 0 for left, 1 for right.
  - `shift_rotate` (1-bit): 0 for shift, 1 for rotate.
- **Output**:
  - `data_out` (32-bit): Result of the shift/rotate operation.

## Operations
The module supports four operations based on `left_right` and `shift_rotate`:
| `left_right` | `shift_rotate` | Operation       | Description                              |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| 0            | 0              | Left Shift      | Shifts left, fills LSBs with 0s.         |
| 1            | 0              | Right Shift     | Shifts right, fills MSBs with 0s.        |
| 0            | 1              | Left Rotate     | Rotates left, wraps MSBs to LSBs.        |
| 1            | 1              | Right Rotate    | Rotates right, wraps LSBs to MSBs.       |

## Implementation Details
- **Module Structure**:
  - Uses `always_comb` for combinational logic.
  - Implements a five-stage barrel shifter (stages 0–4) for shifts of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 bits, controlled by `shift_amt[0:4]`.
  - Each stage conditionally shifts/rotates based on the corresponding bit of `shift_amt`.
  - Final result is assigned to `data_out` from the last stage (`stage4`).
- **Shift/Rotate Logic**:
  - **Left Shift**: Shifts `data_in` left, filling LSBs with 0s.
  - **Right Shift**: Shifts `data_in` right, filling MSBs with 0s.
  - **Left Rotate**: Shifts left, wrapping MSBs to LSBs.
  - **Right Rotate**: Shifts right, wrapping LSBs to MSBs.
  - Each stage uses bit slicing to handle the appropriate shift/rotate amount.

## Edge Cases
1. **Zero Shift Amount**:
   - If `shift_amt = 5'b00000`, `data_out = data_in` (no shift/rotate).
2. **Maximum Shift Amount**:
   - If `shift_amt = 5'b11111` (31), shifts/rotates by 31 positions.
   - For shifts, this results in nearly all bits being 0 (except possibly one bit).
   - For rotates, the result is equivalent to a 31-bit rotation.
3. **Shift vs. Rotate**:
   - Shifts fill vacated bits with 0s, while rotates recycle bits from the opposite end.
4. **Invalid Shift Amounts**:
   - Since `shift_amt` is 5 bits, values are inherently valid (0–31). Larger values are not possible due to input width.

## Usage
To use this module:
1. Instantiate it in your Verilog design.
2. Connect the 32-bit `data_in`, 5-bit `shift_amt`, and control signals `left_right` and `shift_rotate`.
3. Monitor the 32-bit `data_out`.
This barrel shifter is suitable for applications requiring fast, multi-bit shifts or rotations, such as in processors or data processing units.
